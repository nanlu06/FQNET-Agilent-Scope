For Processing the data:
    Tracking, conversion and timingDAQ should be three separate processes running on different cores
    Within each process (of the three) there could be pool processing runnign the same functions for different runs out of the list











if tracking failed: retry tracking 



Making defaults for version in the processing script, to change it through table: change this field and do redo
Redo assumes that the tracking, converion and timing are already complete 


verification: timingdaq with tracks
	      check if the file is there
	      check the entries
	      check the size

verification: timingdaq without tracks
	      check if the file is there
	      check the entries
	      check the size


if conversion failed: retry conversion 
if t and c  both failed: retry everything

if only timingdaq fails try that.

 put all the error outputs in error file

 Make a final wrapper script which take all the commands make a shell script for each command which run them, do short verification and update the run table at the end

Each field you're querying should have entries for all the records
Don't give options in version


Jarvis works for tekscope perfectly
